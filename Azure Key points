 ---Azure Service bus
 Messaging service available in Azure, THere are 2 types Service Bus Queue and Service Bus Topic 
  Service Bus Queue --> Muliple producer but single consumer , where as in Topic --> single Producer multiple Consumers (like broadcast message , might have multiple producers too )
 Have Basic,Standard and premium tiers . to have both Queues and Topics we must use atlease Standard
  the most efficient way to connect to a service bus is using the Transport type AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol). 
 Queues --> Sending messaages can be performed by queueclient class but recieving requires to have RegisterMessageHandler with call back on message recieve and error occured 
 Topics --> Sending messages can be performed by TopicClient class but recieving requries to have SubscriptionClient and RegisterMEssageHandler with callback of message recieve and error message has to be there 
	Three types of filters for subscription for recieving to message: Boolean Filter(TrueFilter or FalseFilter), SQLFilter(we can implement SQL based filter options), CorrelationFilter(filter is based on System and User properties)
