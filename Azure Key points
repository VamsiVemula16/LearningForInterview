---DNS
We need to add ip address to A record and url to txt record in custom domain provider before adding custom domain to webapp

---CosmosDB
Change is not supported for table api 
changefeed will not track deletes
CHangefeed is used by azure functions to run functions when change feed happened
TriggerOperation types (All, Create, Update , Delete and Replace)

---Azcopy
It is ideal to add tenant id when authenticating the azcopy tool 
azcopy login --tenant-id==afanfnaslfnaflknalkf
Azcopy Sync will only sync the dest to sour if there is an change based on last modified time where as using Azcopy copy command even if there is no change in sour and dest it will copy the files which will increase bandwidth

---Application Insights
Funnels : How well application is being used ( number of users hitting various parts of the pages )
We need to add instrumentationkey either in appsetting or can pass directly in initilizing clas(for core in configure services method)
By default it loggs from level warning ,to change it we need add few configurations in appsetting (ApplicationInsights{logLevel{default:debug , Microsoft:error}}})

Application insights has 3 different kinds of data : Users, Sessions and Events
Adaptive Sampling is an technique used to reduce the data ingestion to applicaiton insights from application code 

---Azure FrontDoor
Azure front door works at level 7 (http or https) - Service works at Global level (no region need to be selecte
 Request re-direct can be based on URL,priority. Features like multiple site hosting, session affinity ,SSL Termination , Web Application Firewall
 
 ---Azure Service bus
 Messaging service available in Azure, THere are 2 types Service Bus Queue and Service Bus Topic 
  Service Bus Queue --> Muliple producer but single consumer , where as in Topic --> single Producer multiple Consumers (like broadcast message , might have multiple producers too )
 Have Basic,Standard and premium tiers . to have both Queues and Topics we must use atlease Standard
  the most efficient way to connect to a service bus is using the Transport type AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol). 
 Queues --> Sending messaages can be performed by queueclient class but recieving requires to have RegisterMessageHandler with call back on message recieve and error occured 
 Topics --> Sending messages can be performed by TopicClient class but recieving requries to have SubscriptionClient and RegisterMEssageHandler with callback of message recieve and error message has to be there 
	Three types of filters for subscription for recieving to message: Boolean Filter(TrueFilter or FalseFilter), SQLFilter(we can implement SQL based filter options), CorrelationFilter(filter is based on System and User properties)
	
---API Management	
It is an centrailsed portal containing all internally developed API's in once location. It contains APIGateway, Backend, Policies, Products , Subscriptions and Groups.
Products is an combination of API's.product can be Open or Protected.Protected product requires an subscription to access the APIs , Subscriptions is way users can access the API's. Groups is way to organize the users as either Administrators,Developers, Users and Groups.

---Storage 
Using REST API we can acuire lease on Blobs --> https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/myblob?comp=lease 

-- AZCopy(Storage) 
File copy can be done only by SAS   
BLOB copy can be done by SAS and OAuth 
SAS key types : User Delegation SAS (only to BLOB) , Account SAS and Service SAS 
Blobs snapshots can have different metadata if it specified while creation else it has same properties/metadata like BLOB


---CRON
Expressions are {second} {minute} {hour} {day} {month} {day-of-week}

---Ubuntu
For RDP on ubuntu OS (remote desktop environmnet is not possible) xfce and xrdp is used

---Managed Identites
There are 2 : System-Assigned and User-Assigned (user assigned identity can be assign to one or more instances of azure service) 

---Event Grids
Event grids are mainly event subscription methodlogy, it contains Event Source, Event Grid(itself) and Event Handlers

--Event Hubs
Event hubs are big data streaming platform and event ingestion service. This sevice can be used to recieve and process millions of events per second.
They are consits of : Producers (used to send data to event hub), Partitions (stored events are segregated into pratitions), Consumer Groups (view entire event hub data), Event recievers (a partition of group in consure groups generally mapped to single partition), Throughput units (controls the capacity of event hub) 

Throughputs : (incoming)ingress --> up to 1mb per sec or 1000 events per sec, (outgoing)egress- up to 2 mb per sec or 4096 events per sec


---Azure Service Bus
Whenever possible it is ideal to use Correlation filters over SQL filters because they are much more efficient in processing and have less impact on throughput

---Permission Types : Delegated permission and Application permission
Delegated permission is the permission granted to a signed in user where as Application permission granted to an application.

---Random Points
Integration Service Environmentt is fully isolated and dedicated environmnet for enterprise-scale integration needs. When you create a new integration service environmnet it is injected into azure virtual network which allows you to deploy logic apps as service on your Vnet

 ---Azure Redis Cache 
 To remove the stale keys removed from the cache we can use Eviction policy and set key expiration value 
 
 ---Kudu based deployments
 Deployment configuration files let you override the default heuristics of deployment by allowing you to specify a project or folder to be deployed. Th has to be at root of the repository and it is in .ini format
