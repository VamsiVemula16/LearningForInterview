Below are the list of keywords that present in C#. They are 

Modifier keywords

Statement Keywords
Method parameter keywords
Namespace keywords
Operator Keywords
Access keywords
Literal keywords
Type keywords
Contextual Keywords
Query keywords


Modifier Keywords --> Can modify the types and type members. Modifiers allow or prevent certain parts of programs from being modified by other parts.

Abstract 
Async
const
event 
extern ( Extern keyword is used to declare a method that is implemented externaly using a different launguage(C, C++)
in
out
new
override
partial (is used to split up a class definition across serval files)
readonly
sealed
static
unsafe ( unsafe denotes an unsafe context, which is required for any operations involving pointers. 
virtual 
volatile ( Adding Volatile key words let the compliler know that this field might be modified by multiple thereads at the same time )


Access Modifier Keywords  --> Used for declarion of class, methods and properties, and fields.

Public
Private
Protected
Internal
Protected Internal (Access is limited to the current assembly or types derived from the containing class.)
Private Internal (accessible by types derived from the containing class, but only within its containing assembly)


Statement Keywords

Selection Statements  --> If , else, switch , case
Iteration Statements  --> do , while, for ,foreach, in
Jump Statements --> goto, break , continue , return , yield (You use a yield return statement to return each element one at a time), default
Exeption handling statements --> try , catch , finally , throw 
Checked and unchecked --> checked( help to raise an overflow exception which can only be found at runtime, with out this no exection will be raised ), unchecked ()The unchecked keyword is used to suppress overflow-checking for integral-type arithmetic operations and conversions.
fixed statement  --> fixed (The fixed statement prevents the garbage collector from relocating a movable variable)
lock statment  --> lock


Method Parameter Keywords
Params  (specifies that this parameter may take a variable number of arguments)
ref (pecifies that this parameter is passed by reference and may be read or written by the called method.)
in (specifies that this parameter is passed by reference but is only read by the called method) 
out (pecifies that this parameter is passed by reference and is written by the called method)


Namespace Keywords
using
operator 
:: operator 
extern alias

Contextual keywords (Basically these are not reserved and so can be used as names or identifier. It have only special meaning only in a limited program context)

Add ( Defines a custom event accessor that is invoked when client code subscribes to the event )
Var
