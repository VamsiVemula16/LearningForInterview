PostgreSQL is an open-source object relational database systems. ITt is worlds most advanced open source relational database.

Features of PostgresSQL
  -- Data Types, Data Integrity , Performance, Reliability , Security and Extensibility
  
Command Categories 
  -- DDL , DML , DCL and TCL 
  
In PostgreSQL, a schema is a namespace that contains named database objects such as tables, views, indexes, data types, functions, stored procedures and operators.
A database can contain one or multiple schemas and each schema belongs to only one database. Two schemas can have different objects that share the same name.


PosgtgresSQL structure ==> Database --> Schemas --> Table

Entity & Attributes ==> Attributed can be Composite,Simple,Singe Valued, Multivalued , Stored ,Derived and Complete Attributes
                   Complet attributes ==> Attributes that can be represented by grouping composite attributes between (), separating the components with commas, and by displaying multivalued attributes between [] are known as complex attributes.


Keys in Database ==> 
    Candidate --> Minimum set of attributes which can uniquely identify the tuple.Can be simple key or composite key.
        Super --> Any set of attributes which can uniquely identify the tuple.Can be simple key or composite key.
    Alternate --> Candidate key other than primary key is alternate key
    Primary, Secondary;
    
Contraint ==> NOT NULL, UNIQUE, Check ==> This ensures that all the values in a column satisfy a specific condition , DEFAULT, INDEX ==> This contraint is used to create and retrieve data from the database very quickly.

Nomarlization is techniguq that organizes tables in such a way that redundancy and dependency of data is reduced.
 1NF, 2NF , 3NF and BCNF
 
 1NF --> Each table cell should have single value. So basically all the records must be unique.
 2NF --> Should be 1NF and should also have single column primary key
 3NF --> Should be 2NF and must not have any transitive functional dependencies
BCNF --> Should be 3NF, there would be some scenarios where anomalies whould be present, if you have more than 1 candidate key. Then BCNF comes into action where you divide your tables further so that there would be only one candidate key present.

Syntax: (captials are keywords)

Creating Schema ==> CREATE SCHEMA mynewSchema;
Truncate table ==> TRUNCATE TABLE students; ( just remove all the data in the table)
Rename table ==> ALTER TABLE students RENAME TO newStudnets;
DROP table ==> DROP TABLE students;
Add column ==> ALTER TABLE students ADD dob date , ADD sex char, ADD marks integer;
Alter datatype ==> ALTER TABLE students ALTER COLUMN marks TYPE character;
DROP Column ==> ALTER TABLE students DROP COLUMN marks;
RENAME Column ==> ALTER TABLE students RENAME COLUMN sex TO gender;
DELETE rows ==> DELETE from studnets where id =11;
